They were sons, daughters, fathers, grandfathers. They wore an assortment of camouflage fatigues and traditional Kurdish flowing pants, waist sashes and head scarves. They carried antique Kalashnikovs and new assault rifles. Few had helmets, and fewer had body armor. Strapped to their backs and belts and legs were daggers, revolvers, axes. Some of them had received the call to duty only the day before and were driven to the front by family or rode overnight in taxis. With them was a column of vehicles new, old and very old: armored personnel carriers,     vehicles (MRAPs) Humvees, S. U. V. s, ambulances, Soviet tanks, backhoes, bulldozers,   sedans and a bestiary of retrofitted pickups and battlewagons, whose tenuous welding and argumentative suspensions told of the years Iraqi Kurds had spent fighting with    and homemade hardware in one war or another. At 7 a. m. the idling engines came to life, and cries went up: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLong live pesh merga!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cDeath to ISIS!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The troops started down an unpaved track that led southwest through the Tigris River valley toward the city of Mosul. As the march went on, villages gave way to occasional abandoned farmhouses, crop fields to dunes, and the sun made itself felt. A long dust cloud rose in the wake of the column, whose eventual destination was Bashiqa, a small city on the mountain\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s edge that was claimed by the Islamic State. The operation to retake Mosul had finally begun one week earlier on Oct. 16. The pesh merga led the charge toward the city, Iraq\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s   and ISIS\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 last citadel in the country. Mosul had become the focus of the world\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s attention, and the battle for it had been criticized even before it began. In the second presidential debate, Donald Trump complained that in revealing its designs on Mosul, the international   coalition was telegraphing its punches. This was inevitably true  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   not even ISIS had ever doubted that Mosul would be invaded  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   but it was also true that the first flurry of blows was too big to duck. Embedded in the column was a unit of American Special Forces, in a cluster of MRAPs. They were there, it was understood, to pick out targets for airstrikes. Rumbling in the distance, the bombs had deposited on the horizon a dome of inky vapor. While the pesh merga attacked ISIS from the north and the east, the Iraqi military was approaching from the south. The job of the battalion moving toward Bashiqa was to shore up the eastern front and extend a cordon around Mosul. The Iraqis\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 next moves would depend in part on the Kurds\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 success. For the moment, in other words, the progress of the central conflict in the Middle East had come down to this unlikely troop. The first ISIS mortar fire arrived in the midmorning with whizzes and thuds. It was off target, and the soldiers regarded the dirt plumes with indifference. The first incoming bullets soon followed and were cause for more alarm. They flew from a rambling,     house on the crest of a slope. The gunfire split the column in two. The back portion halted behind a berm about 12 feet high and about 300 yards downslope from the house. A few soldiers climbed up the dirt and took aim. The rest got out of their vehicles and pulled out phones and cigarettes. Group photos and selfies were snapped. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLet\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s use the cannon,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a commander suggested. A pickup mounted with an   gun pulled in front of the berm. The first shot fell short a second hit the house, leaving a disappointingly small hole in the facade. When there was a pause in the fighting, a group of trucks emerged from behind the berm, raced up the track and cut right onto a hillock that overlooked the house. Some pesh merga got out and gathered. They presented a clear target for snipers and artillery, but they didn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t appear to mind. They chatted, laughed, smoked, checked their phones. More group photos, more selfies. Even after two mortar rounds landed in quick succession on either side of them  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   a sign that a spotter was nearby, bracketing their position  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   they remained unhurried. Eventually they got back into their vehicles and, under fire from the house, headed straight for it. The ISIS fighters had built their own berm beside the house\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s exterior wall. The Kurdish soldiers backed their trucks up to it, and one of them opened up on the house with a   machine gun. Others peeked over the berm, taking the occasional potshot. One walked up to a gap in the dirt and, with neither cover nor helmet, a cigarette dangling from his lips, emptied a magazine. The   jammed. The fighting subsided again. The soldiers reclined at the base of the berm. Out came the phones. More selfies. Texting. A man called his mother. Another watched a video of a firefight taking place on some other front around Mosul. None of them seemed eager to storm the house. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m deaf from that cannon!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cDid you take any photos of it being shot?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another asked him. The gunner got into an argument with another soldier over whose responsibility it had been to make sure the   was working properly that morning. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cYou were supposed to fix it!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s not my job!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s not as if you had to build an airplane. It\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s simple. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cYou came all the way to the front in a taxi, and now all you do is talk. You just talk. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Another burst of gunfire from the house, and a soldier climbed behind the   gun. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cCome help me,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he instructed a colleague. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t know how. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIf you don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t get up here and help me, I\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m going to do everything that\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s bad to you. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The gun was loaded and fired. The backblast shattered a pickup\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s windshield. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cBazan, where are your cigarettes?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Bazan ran to a truck and returned with a pack of cigarettes. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWho wants a cigarette?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The group lit up. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cEveryone here talks like a man,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cbut no one fights like one. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d There was a note of false modesty in this quip. In fact, for centuries Kurds have fought famously, taking on all comers: Persians, Ottomans, Arabs, British and the various governments of Iraq. A diffuse institution  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cmore an attitude than an army,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d as one Kurd put it  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   the pesh merga today contain anywhere from several tens of thousands to about a hundred thousand fighters, depending on who\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s counting and how proud he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s feeling. Many are volunteers. Only some of them have training that would warrant the name in a major military. The one thing they all share is that they are willing to die for their land. If their tactics are negligible  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and sometimes as suicidal as those of the jihadists  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   their bravery is not. The pesh merga are commanded by Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government. When ISIS overran Mosul in June 2014, Barzani offered the help of his army to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal   who snubbed him. It was assumed Maliki worried that Barzani intended to annex whatever land his troops took. Maliki\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s successor, Haider   may have delayed the invasion of Mosul for the same reason. But earlier this year, Barzani, Abadi and the international coalition arrived at an agreement that called for the Kurdish forces to halt their advance at Bashiqa. About six miles from the eastern outskirts of Mosul, Bashiqa was inhabited largely by Christians, Kurds and members of the Yazidi minority, most of whom fled when ISIS arrived. The city presented an added political wrinkle in the war because it is in the \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cdisputed territories,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d land claimed by both Iraq and the Kurdish regional government. Certain Kurds, mainly older ones, consider Mosul theirs, too. Partly for this reason  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   but more because they\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re accustomed to fighting against the Iraqi military, not alongside it  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   some pesh merga worried they would be attacked, or at least mistreated, by Iraqi soldiers when the two forces met on the front lines. Speculation about a sequel war between Kurdistan and Iraq was (and still is) commonplace. But so far relations were cordial, and the Iraqi military, knowing it would have its hands full with the close combat in Mosul\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ancient streets, was content to leave the Bashiqa campaign to the Kurds. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis war is very different for us Kurds,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Barzani\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s brother, Sihad Barzani, explained several days after the campaign began. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis is the first time we\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ve seen airstrikes that we\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re not afraid of. This is the first time the Iraqi Army is not trying to kill us  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and we\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re not trying to kill them. We hope it stays this way. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He was in a large abandoned house that the pesh merga had commandeered and turned into a field headquarters on the periphery of Bashiqa. The march had brought them to the limits of the city. They had not yet entered, but they had it surrounded. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS has no escape. They will have to die now. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The Barzanis are de facto royalty in Kurdistan. Massoud and Sihad\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s father, Mustafa, the patriarch of the incipient Iraqi Kurdish republic, led its revolution against Iraq until his death in 1979. It\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s common to meet pesh merga with tattoos of Mustafa\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s portrait. As Sihad stepped from the house, a young soldier lifted up his shirt to reveal the face of Mustafa, with his thick black mustache and checkered red head scarf, sprawled across his back. Sihad looked on approvingly. Asked how many of his own family members were fighting ISIS, he gestured at the soldiers gathered in the courtyard and said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re all my family. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The Tigris River valley is dotted with villages and olive groves. The ISIS fighters inhabiting it were experienced and disciplined. What they lacked in munitions they made up for in patience, as the pesh merga had learned. Some Kurds had developed a reluctant respect for their adversary. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey fight as if they want to die,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d it was often said. The night before, the jihadists had told the residents of Buharbuq, an   village near Bashiqa, to be ready to leave at 6 a. m. for Mosul. The intent was obvious: They would be used as human shields. In the middle of the night, the village fled en masse. After leaving the headquarters, Barzani\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s convoy passed the refugee caravan, 80 or so cars and trucks stretched along a roadside. The residents of Buharbuq had taken everyone and everything they could: children, mattresses, blankets, grandmothers, pots, buckets, sheep, chickens. One truck contained a motorized wheelchair, another seven newborn lambs. The women were still dressed according to ISIS decree, fully covered in black hijabs and abayas. Officers with the Asayish, a Kurdish internal security agency, met the villagers on the road with a fleet of buses that would take them to a   camp. A soldier pulled up with a freight truck full of crackers and water. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAll of our life is wasted in this ISIS mess,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a woman waiting in line said to her husband. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI feel a hundred years old. I hope ISIS goes to hell, then rots in hell. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m so tired,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d her husband replied. There were heartsick roadside reunions. Two old classmates, one a pesh merga who had fled Buharbuq, the other a shop owner who had stayed, hugged for the first time in two years. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLife was very bitter,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the shop owner told his friend. He pulled from his pocket a   note, less than a dollar. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis is all my money. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d A young man found his mother. She clung to his neck and wept and kissed his face again and again. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThank God,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d she muttered. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThank God. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Perhaps the bravest pesh merga are the drivers of earthmovers, who toil mere yards from ISIS positions. They are bombed, mortared, rocketed and sniped, all the while doing astonishingly fast work. Within two days of setting off toward Bashiqa, they had turned the valley into a grid of berms and trenches that prevented an ISIS breakout and cut off the group\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s supply lines. About 4, 000 Kurdish soldiers now occupied 100 positions and small encampments. The main camp was presided over by Barham Arif, one of the youngest and most respected generals in the pesh merga. Tall and taciturn, he led his men into battle in a jaunty     MRAP with a GoPro camera   to the hood. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS is not smart and not brave, but they brainwash stupid people,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Arif said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey give drugs to their fighters. They fight for 20 minutes and then run away. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d For months, Arif had lived with his men on the pesh merga\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s stalemated front line, on the ridge of Bashiqa Mountain, overlooking the valley. A modest cult of personality had formed around the general, and his camp was home to foreign volunteers and soldiers of fortune. There were American medics, a Brazilian and Czech videographer couple and, constantly at Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s side, a   Scottish   sniper in spectacles. On Facebook, under employer, he listed \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cpesh merga. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Generations of Kurds also converged in the camp. A few soldiers were in their 20s. Most were in their 30s, 40s and 50s. One soldier who had come down from the mountain with Arif was Kaefe Ahmed. Ahmed\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s father, also a pesh merga fighter, was killed by Iraqi soldiers when Ahmed was 4. Ten other family members had died in war. Ahmed refused to wear a camouflage uniform because, he said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cfor decades the Iraqi Army destroyed our land with these uniforms. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He had fought for more than 20 of his 37 years: in the Kurdish civil war, against Saddam Hussein\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s forces and now against ISIS. He and his cousin Robar Ali were in a unit with a   group of men, some of them related. When ISIS entered Mosul, they fought on its outskirts, before the pesh merga were ordered to withdraw. Had ISIS stopped there, Ahmed and Ali, like most Iraqi Kurds, wouldn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t have worried much about the jihadists living nearby. This was a conflict among Arabs, they felt, and at first ISIS was better than Saddam\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s Baathists ever were. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIn the beginning, the ISIS fighters were generally good with people,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Ahmed said. But then ISIS pushed into Kurdistan. Ahmed and Ali fought them in Sinjar, and then in Bashiqa, before it was overrun. The fighting there was particularly bitter. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re suicidal,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. The oldest soldier in the camp, as far as anyone knew, was a man named Jamil Rashid. When asked about his age, he first said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cA lot. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Later offerings ranged from 61 to 78. Asked how many battles he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099d fought in over the years, he said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThat notebook does not have enough paper to write them all down. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He ate what food local   brought to the camp and slept wrapped in a thin blanket in a ditch. Five of his sons were in the pesh merga. One had recently been killed by ISIS. He had more grandchildren than he cared to count. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS is nothing  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   they\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ve been around for two years,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d said Rashid, who was fond of listing, in the profanest terms possible, the Iraqi premiers whose regimes he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099d fought against. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAbd   Qasim\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   the Iraqi prime minister of the early 1960s. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI screwed his mother. Then there was Ahmed Hassan   and then Saddam, and then Nuri  . He was a bad guy. And now  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   what\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s his name again?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAbadi,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a young soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cRight, Abadi. I fought all of them on this holy ground  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   for this holy ground. Our mud is holy. Whoever doesn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t fight for his land takes it in the [expletive]. This land is so precious. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWhy are you talking about history, Jamil?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another young soldier asked him. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re supposed to be discussing now. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cSo what if I talk about history?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Rashid said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s all the same, history and now. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d On Tuesday morning, Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s men prepared to assault Omar Qapchi, a village barely a   from his camp that was still under ISIS control. A commander had got hold of some villagers on a cellphone and was telling them what to do when the fighting started. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cStay together, don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t separate,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIf you see any ISIS, call this number. Take care of yourselves. We\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re coming. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The armored personnel carriers and tanks and trucks filled up in moments. Far more soldiers wanted to take part in the assault than there was space in vehicles. Omar Qapchi, spreading about a mile down a slope that ended in an arterial road at the foot of Bashiqa Mountain, was made up of tightly packed   and   homes. Near its western gate, the column split into three smaller convoys. Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s convoy cut across a field toward the road. Though the ground was known to be full of I. E. D. s, some pesh merga cut one another off as they careered over suspicious patches of dirt and objects, racing to get into the action. When the convoy reached the road, muzzle flashes appeared in windows, and bullets whizzed by. The pesh merga strafed the buildings with   fire and grenades. At the eastern gate, the convoy hooked into the village. The streets were empty. From the residents who had phoned, it was known that about a dozen ISIS fighters were somewhere in the village. The convoy raced into the village center and suddenly found itself in a firefight with a contingent of ISIS gunmen, who, surrounded, had taken a stand at one end of a short, wide alley. The soldiers, on the other end, jumped from their vehicles, piled into the alley  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   directly in the line of fire  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and began shooting back. There was little aiming but a lot of yelling. One man stepped into the alley with a grenade launcher. He pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He held the rocket inches from his nose and looked at it quizzically. As bullets hit the dirt near his feet, he slowly peeled off a piece of plastic wrapping, then lifted the launcher back onto his shoulder and tried again. This time it fired. The ISIS fighters took to their heels, and the soldiers, among them Ahmed, gave chase, eventually cornering several jihadists in a mosque. One detonated a suicide vest another was sheared in half by a rocket. By the end of the day, eight of them had died, three had escaped and one was captured. Three pesh merga sustained minor wounds. Rather than going on foot from house to house to make sure the village was cleared, they gathered outside it and celebrated. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI think I killed someone,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Rashid said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt would be a shame if I shot my rifle and didn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t kill anyone. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Two days later, the wind at their backs, Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s men moved on Faziliya, a neighboring village. The road to the village was littered with I. E. D. s, which sent up showers of gravel and tarmac. On the wall of a kiosk at the entrance to the village was  : \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cEvery ISIS man who dies goes to paradise. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d An ISIS flag fluttered on a fence post, but the roofs of the houses, which ranged steeply up the foot of the mountain, bore newly hung white flags: The town\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s residents were eagerly awaiting the pesh merga\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s arrival. Then gun and rocket fire erupted from a small, windowed spire on a building near the road. A tank reduced the building to smoking rubble. The people of Faziliya streamed from their homes and into the streets. They patted their heads  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   a Kurdish gesture of welcome  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and kissed the soldiers. Children chanted: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLong live pesh merga! Long live pesh merga!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d In the village square, a group of boys tore down an ISIS billboard. Soldiers shot off celebratory rounds. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWho has cigarettes?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a man asked the soldiers. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe want to smoke!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d A soldier found his wife and children  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   their first meeting in more than two years. His mother emerged. She took hold of her son. They sank to the ground in an embrace, their tears streaming together. Back at Omar Qapchi, the few residents who had remained for the battle were gathered outside the village next to a caged soccer pitch, where they awaited interrogation by the soldiers and Asayish officers. An elderly woman wanted to know where her brother was. A rocket had destroyed his house, and he was nowhere to be seen. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cHe\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s dead,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a neighbor of hers explained, out of earshot, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cbut she hasn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t found out yet. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d An officer had already determined that one resident was allied with ISIS. The man was dragged from the group, his hands bound behind his back with a scarf. A green knit face mask was pulled down over his eyes, and he was forced to the ground. He pleaded his innocence. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cShut up, you imbecile!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier yelled at him. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s obvious he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ISIS,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cJust look at his color. He\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s taken on the jihadists\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 color. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m not with ISIS, I swear!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the prisoner said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m a Kurd!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cShut up or I\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ll stuff this down your throat!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the first soldier said, jabbing his rifle\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s stock in the man\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s face. The officer was from Omar Qapchi and had fled the village as ISIS approached it in 2014. From his friends who had stayed, he had heard that the prisoner had driven an ambulance for the jihadists. His son, they said, was with ISIS, too. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI haven\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t done anything!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the prisoner protested. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI was just told to drive somewhere. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cHit him already,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another soldier said. The prisoner\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s son, his hands also bound and face covered, was pushed down beside his father. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMy son is a student in Bashiqa,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the father said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ll tell you anything about him. Please don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t put the gun to his head. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m just following orders,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cDon\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t worry,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d said an Asayish commander who had arrived on the scene. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t know if he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ISIS. We have to investigate. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cYou\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ve humiliated my son!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cSo are you saying your son is ISIS or not?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the soldier asked. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cHe\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s a student! He\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s in ninth grade!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d They were bundled into the bed of a pickup and driven away. The Islamic State, the pesh merga knew, hadn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t conquered such large swaths of the country with weapons alone. It had won sympathy among many Sunni Muslims who felt neglected by Iraq\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s   national government and abused by security forces. ISIS promised them protection and pride. Many of them saw ISIS as a way out of an already miserable existence. In a   camp near Khazer, another   town, an elderly farmer who\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099d fled the village of Topzawa, not far from Bashiqa, which the Iraqi military had taken a few days before, talked about the jihadists fondly. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMost of the young men who joined ISIS were poor,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey needed the money. They had no other options. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He confessed that he had come to know some of the ISIS men in Topzawa well. They weren\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t foreigners, but Iraqis, ordinary ones. They were kind. They allowed him to travel wherever he wanted to sell his produce. He didn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t mind that the women in his family had to put on more clothing, and he wore a beard anyway. They treated his wife and daughters with the respect that Islam required. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAt the beginning of Islam, with Muhammad, there were good rules. But with democracy, there are no rules. I\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m a fair person. I believe in justice. But there are rules in Islam. No one can change them. Not you, not me, not anyone. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS treated us as though we were free,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he went on. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe felt secure under them. In the final battle, they conducted themselves honorably. They fought until they died. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The Iraqi Army, by contrast, relied on foreign airstrikes. The bombs had killed 20 of his sheep, 10 of his chickens and 10 dogs, and when the soldiers finally arrived, they were \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cvery, very bad. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d They forced him from his home and made him come to this camp, where he endured humiliations. His hands were bound. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey attacked my honor. They told me my wife and daughters had been raped by ISIS. I was disgraced. I wanted to kill myself. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Two weeks after the Bashiqa campaign began, President Barzani still hadn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t given the order to attack the city itself. Rumors about what would be found in it expanded by the day. The number of ISIS fighters supposedly hiding out there crept upward. There would be no end of I. E. D. s, people said, of suicide   of snipers. There would be tunnels everywhere. At General Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s camp, the berms had grown taller and the foxholes deeper. ISIS fighters had attacked by night, and by day they lobbed in mortar rounds and handcrafted missiles. Jamil Rashid spoke with a group of younger soldiers as gunfire rang out. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis is nothing,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s air. I like the sound of it. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Finally, the order was given. The night before the assault, Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s troops gathered on the mountain above Bashiqa, in their old position. Ahmed and his cousin Ali were part of group of about 30 men who would descend the slope and enter Bashiqa on foot. In the morning, an armored column collected on a road outside the city. Sihad Barzani arrived to wish them luck. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe must move, but slowly,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. For six hours, the column crept toward the city, while airstrikes and artillery pummeled it. As they waited, soldiers checked for news of the American election, the next day, on their phones. Word came down that a sniper was holed up somewhere inside. He had already killed one soldier and wounded four. On the access road into the city\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s east end, which climbed up the mountainside, the column drove by a pesh merga bulldozer in flames, the driver incinerated in the cab. As in Omar Qapchi, the streets were quiet. But as the vehicles turned by a small park, a   grenade flew at it. Its orange fireball and white smoke trail, visible for less than a second, were terribly beautiful. The rocket exploded against the low concrete wall of the park. Another quickly followed behind it. The column made it to a central plaza. A handsome old church with a suspicious tower was peppered with   fire and artillery. Jamil Rashid hopped from the front seat of a truck and took up a position outside the church. Standing in the open, his rifle dangling by his leg, he looked around and breathed in the scent of gun smoke, beaming. The column turned back along the same road it had entered. But now there was an empty white sedan in the middle of an intersection. Was this a car bomb? A roadblock? Had some innocent tried to flee and suffered a breakdown? The driver of the lead tank stuck his head from the turret hatch. A shot cracked the air, its tone higher and sharper than that of a Kalashnikov. Blood sprayed from the driver\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s head. He slumped over the turret. His crew mates began screaming and crying. Panic passed down the line. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cSniper! Sniper!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The column reversed course, honking and   and labored back to the plaza. The tank sped from the city by a different route. At the staging point, the driver\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s body was lifted out and put in an ambulance. His friends bent over the tank\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s side skirt and knelt in the dirt, weeping. Before the driver was shot, Ahmed, Ali and their detachment had descended into the same side of the city on foot. They came under fire, retreated back uphill and took up a position. A   crack. Ali lurched forward, falling over Ahmed\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s leg. Ahmed thought his cousin had tripped. Then he saw the blood. Three days later, Ahmed was worrying a string of wooden prayer beads in a mosque in his and Ali\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s hometown, Rawanduz, in Kurdistan\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s eastern mountains. He sat by the muezzin, who sang a death prayer for Ali, a Quran open before him on a desk stand. Old pesh merga in traditional dress and younger ones in suits and jeans filed in. They greeted Ali\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s father and Ahmed, their hands to their chests, saying: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMay he rest in peace\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d and \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMay God forgive him his sins. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d After the service, long rugs were spread on the floor, and Ahmed and the men from his unit sat down to lunch. Their part in the fight against ISIS was over, for now. Bashiqa was liberated, and the Kurdish line stopped there. But the war against ISIS was not going well for the Iraqi Army, which was still stuck on Mosul\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s outskirts, taking a lot of casualties. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt will be a heavy fight,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d one man said. Ahmed and his friends would fight in Mosul if they were ordered to, they agreed, but they wouldn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t like it. They were not among the Kurds who considered the city part of the homeland. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIs it fair that a Kurd should die for an Arab?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Ahmed said. Anyway, history had taught them that another war would come soon enough. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cOnce you finish one fight, they prepare another one for you,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt makes you tired. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d\",\n          \"Share on Twitter \\nThe battle of campaign rallies has been going strong throughout the 2016 presidential election, with both candidates amassing pretty large crowds. \\nJust last month, the Washington Post compared two separate September rallies for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. \\nTrump's had a crowd of 15,000, at his Sept. 27th rally in Melbourne, Florida: Unbelievable evening in Melbourne, Florida w/ 15,000 supporters- and an additional 12,000 who could not get in.

They raised the 2016 American League pennant and handed out rings before the focus turned back to the current season. It is a season in which the Indians may again be one of the top teams in baseball, but it is also one in which they may have to wrestle increasingly with the issue of Chief Wahoo, the smiling caricature that has long been an Indians logo but has come to be seen as offensive and wildly outdated. Among those who think it is time for the club to decisively move away from the logo is the Major League Baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, who in continuing discussions with the team\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ownership is beginning to apply a little bit of pressure on the club to come up with a plan of action. In a statement to The New York Times, Pat Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said Manfred, in his talks with the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 owners, had made clear his \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cdesire to transition away from the Chief Wahoo logo. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe have specific steps in an identified process and are making progress,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 Courtney added. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe are confident that a positive resolution will be reached that will be good for the game and the club. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 Although Manfred had previously acknowledged a willingness to engage in talks with the Indians about the logo, Courtney\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s statement appears to be the first time that Manfred is identified as having staked out a clear position on the issue. It is an issue, however, that may not be that easy to resolve. Although many people, including baseball fans around the country, would welcome the removal of Chief Wahoo, there is a significant segment of the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 fan base that still cherishes the logo, which has existed in various forms since 1947. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cChief Wahoo is the Cleveland Indians,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d said Karen Hale, a local Indians fan who was outside the stadium before Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s game. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI think there comes a time when you have to take a stand for what you believe in. I don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t think it\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s hurting anybody. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Philip Yenyo, the executive director of the American Indian Movement of Ohio, has been protesting at the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 opening day games for years and vehemently disagrees with Hale and others with similar views. He would prefer the team eliminate the logo, and the Indians name as well, but he would be happy for the club to start with the logo. During this year\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s protest, Yenyo engaged in a cordial conversation with a team employee. And Yenyo said that over the years the Indians had been very cooperative in arranging for security to protect the two dozen or so protesters who do show up outside the stadium. Still, as Yenyo spoke through a megaphone at Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s demonstration, a man barreled through the protesters and yelled at him: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s a caricature. Get over it. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Bob DiBiasio, the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 senior vice president for public affairs, said during Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s home opener that the club understood the passion on both sides of the issue and that in some ways the team was caught in the middle, trying to find an amicable solution. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo, those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a longstanding attachment to its place in the history of the team,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. DiBiasio called the continuing talks productive between Manfred and Paul Dolan, the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 chairman and chief executive. With their sights set on a return to the World Series, the Indians would prefer to address Chief Wahoo after the season to avoid any distractions that could alienate a large swath of fans while games are being played. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cOur primary focus right now is on the team,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 he said. And it may be a really good team, especially with the addition of Edwin Encarnacion, the   slugger who left Toronto to sign a   $60 million contract with the Indians. The club has already sold 1. 3 million tickets for the 2017 season, DiBiasio said, noting that it did not reach that mark until the end of July last year. In 2016, Cleveland\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s attendance was 28th out of 30 teams with 1. 59 million tickets sold, but in the wake of the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 2016 postseason run, that number is now likely to soar. Manager Terry Francona noted Tuesday that his team seemed to thrive when the stadium was full, as it was Tuesday, when the Indians prevailed in extra innings against the Chicago White Sox. And sure enough, many of the fans in attendance wore the Chief Wahoo logo on their hats and shirts. The move to do away with the logo appeared to begin when Mark Shapiro, who is now running the Blue Jays, was the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 team president for baseball operations. Shapiro was the driving force behind   the block C logo, which has been seen on Cleveland caps since 1902 and has recently become more prominent on various uniform and cap combinations the Indians use, as well as around the stadium. During last year\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s American League Championship Series between the Blue Jays and Indians, Shapiro said that he was personally troubled by the Wahoo logo and suggested that its days were numbered. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI think there will be a day, whenever that is, that the people that are making decisions here decide that Chief Wahoo is no longer fitting,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said then. When the   Jays playoff series moved to Toronto last October, an indigenous Canadian citizen filed for an injunction to prevent Cleveland from using the Wahoo logo while in Canada. Major League Baseball joined the Indians in opposing the injunction, which was not granted. But in its statement at the time baseball said it also welcomed dialogue about the logo. That dialogue began in the weeks after the World Series and will most likely continue until a resolution is reached. At Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s game, the Chief Wahoo logo could not be seen anywhere on the stadium building or on the field, but it was on the left sleeves of the blue jerseys worn by the Indians players and on their caps. And it was on the white uniform shirts worn by the Cleveland sports legends Jim Brown, Austin Carr and Jim Thome when they went to the mound to throw out the celebratory first pitches before the game. The logo could also be found on many items in the team souvenir shop, along with stickers depicting an even harsher representation of Chief Wahoo from an earlier period. For now, at least, the logo still survives and even thrives.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Those agencies proclaim this with a rock-solid conviction that I have not heard since Vice President DIck Cheney told us all that \\\"there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.\\\" Add to that, the rock-solid evidence of Saddam's treachery that Colin Powell presented to the UN Security Council. The mainstream corporate media bought it whole.\\nHowever, as all know today, these were lies. Saddam had no WMDs, and there were no Iraqi chemical weapons \\\"Winebagos of Death\\\" vividly described by Colin Powell.\\nNow we are told, \\\"with high confidence,\\\" that Vladimir Putin's Kremlin has launched a cyber attack to disrupt our presidential election. Never mind that, as MIT expert Theodore Postol has written that there is, \\\"no technical way that the US intelligence community could know who did the hacking if it was done by sophisticated nation-state actors.\\\"\\nThe lies that launched the disastrous Iraq war have had lasting consequences to the credibility of the United States Government. The last time that government cried \\\"wolf,\\\" there was no wolf. Why should we believe it now?\\nSo no, I am not convinced. There is good reason not to believe the \\\"Kremlin hack\\\" story.\\nA crucial distinction is in order: First, there is the actual content of the hacked emails. Second, there are the consequences of the general media assumption and public belief that the emails were a Kremlin plot to disrupt the presidential election.\\nAs for the content , it was trivial and still worse, not credible. There is nothing remarkable in the disclosed content of the hacked emails. They might, if believed, cause John Podesta some embarrassment. In addition, they might reveal that the Democratic National Committee is controlled by a political elite. But we already know that.\\nBut why should we believe any of that content? If, as claimed, the leaks came from the Kremlin, there is not, and cannot be, any authentication of the hacked emails unless the original sources (e.g, John Podesta) produce the originals. And why would they? Accordingly, the leakers (whoever they might be) are free to concoct forgeries at will. And of course, it follows that we, the intended audience, are advised to ignore all of them.\\nFurthermore, , why would Putin want to use these emails to \\\"rig\\\" our election? To tilt the election toward Trump? If that is his motive, it has backfired spectacularly. That alleged \\\"disclosure\\\" of the hacking has benefited Clinton far more than Trump. It is one of her favorite talking points, as we discovered in the final debate.\\nSo we are left with two alternate conclusions: The Russian government likely had no part in the leaking. Or if they did, the leaks will have little or no effect on the election, except to provide Hillary Clinton with a talking point and to embarrass John Podesta.\\nIn short, the Wikileaks hacks, whatever the source, appear to be a just a prank: A trifle, blown hugely out of proportion by a scandal-hungry media.\\nHowever, even though the content of the hacked emails may be trivial and not credible, the consequences of the accusation of Kremlin connivance could be catastrophic.\\nFirst of all, as we are finding out, the neo-cons and the media are using the hacks to intensify the demonization of Putin and to heat up the renewed Cold War.\\nStill worse, as Joe Biden stated recently on Meet the Press , the accusation that Putin is behind the hacks and their release might provoke a cyber retaliation from the United States.\\nA Kremlin spokesman has called Biden's threat a a \\\"virtual American declaration of war on Russia.\\\"\\nIf, as Biden warns, the United States retaliates, then the Russian response might, unlike the present alleged leaks, be devastating to the US economy.\\nBe assured that a \\\"cyber-war\\\" entails infinitely more than leaked emails. It might include the shutdown of the internet and emails. Also, the disruption of business and financial communications and utility grids. The world today runs on silicon and microprocessors. Imagine returning home to no electric power, phone service or access to the internet. Add to that, no restocking of the local supermarket or gas stations. And no capability of the government to make prompt repairs. The result: Total economic shutdown.\\nWe can do this to Russia, and be assured that Russia can do this to us.\\nThe reality of cyber attacks is no mere speculation, we have seen them at work. The Iranian nuclear weapons program was severely damaged and set back by a CIA implanted computer virus. And this past month, large regions of the United States temporarily lost internet service. The cause remains unknown.\\nHas Joe Biden thought through the implications of his threat? Is this the horror that Biden wants to unleash on us and the world in response to an essentially harmless prank? To what purpose? Some kind of capitulation by the Russians? No chance of that.\\nA far more likely result would be an escalation from cyber to military combat. And then what?\\nWhere are the cool-headed grownups, now that we need them?\\nDr. Ernest Partridge is a consultant, writer and lecturer in the field of Environmental Ethics and Public Policy.

They were sons, daughters, fathers, grandfathers. They wore an assortment of camouflage fatigues and traditional Kurdish flowing pants, waist sashes and head scarves. They carried antique Kalashnikovs and new assault rifles. Few had helmets, and fewer had body armor. Strapped to their backs and belts and legs were daggers, revolvers, axes. Some of them had received the call to duty only the day before and were driven to the front by family or rode overnight in taxis. With them was a column of vehicles new, old and very old: armored personnel carriers,     vehicles (MRAPs) Humvees, S. U. V. s, ambulances, Soviet tanks, backhoes, bulldozers,   sedans and a bestiary of retrofitted pickups and battlewagons, whose tenuous welding and argumentative suspensions told of the years Iraqi Kurds had spent fighting with    and homemade hardware in one war or another. At 7 a. m. the idling engines came to life, and cries went up: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLong live pesh merga!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cDeath to ISIS!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The troops started down an unpaved track that led southwest through the Tigris River valley toward the city of Mosul. As the march went on, villages gave way to occasional abandoned farmhouses, crop fields to dunes, and the sun made itself felt. A long dust cloud rose in the wake of the column, whose eventual destination was Bashiqa, a small city on the mountain\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s edge that was claimed by the Islamic State. The operation to retake Mosul had finally begun one week earlier on Oct. 16. The pesh merga led the charge toward the city, Iraq\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s   and ISIS\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 last citadel in the country. Mosul had become the focus of the world\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s attention, and the battle for it had been criticized even before it began. In the second presidential debate, Donald Trump complained that in revealing its designs on Mosul, the international   coalition was telegraphing its punches. This was inevitably true  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   not even ISIS had ever doubted that Mosul would be invaded  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   but it was also true that the first flurry of blows was too big to duck. Embedded in the column was a unit of American Special Forces, in a cluster of MRAPs. They were there, it was understood, to pick out targets for airstrikes. Rumbling in the distance, the bombs had deposited on the horizon a dome of inky vapor. While the pesh merga attacked ISIS from the north and the east, the Iraqi military was approaching from the south. The job of the battalion moving toward Bashiqa was to shore up the eastern front and extend a cordon around Mosul. The Iraqis\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 next moves would depend in part on the Kurds\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 success. For the moment, in other words, the progress of the central conflict in the Middle East had come down to this unlikely troop. The first ISIS mortar fire arrived in the midmorning with whizzes and thuds. It was off target, and the soldiers regarded the dirt plumes with indifference. The first incoming bullets soon followed and were cause for more alarm. They flew from a rambling,     house on the crest of a slope. The gunfire split the column in two. The back portion halted behind a berm about 12 feet high and about 300 yards downslope from the house. A few soldiers climbed up the dirt and took aim. The rest got out of their vehicles and pulled out phones and cigarettes. Group photos and selfies were snapped. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLet\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s use the cannon,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a commander suggested. A pickup mounted with an   gun pulled in front of the berm. The first shot fell short a second hit the house, leaving a disappointingly small hole in the facade. When there was a pause in the fighting, a group of trucks emerged from behind the berm, raced up the track and cut right onto a hillock that overlooked the house. Some pesh merga got out and gathered. They presented a clear target for snipers and artillery, but they didn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t appear to mind. They chatted, laughed, smoked, checked their phones. More group photos, more selfies. Even after two mortar rounds landed in quick succession on either side of them  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   a sign that a spotter was nearby, bracketing their position  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   they remained unhurried. Eventually they got back into their vehicles and, under fire from the house, headed straight for it. The ISIS fighters had built their own berm beside the house\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s exterior wall. The Kurdish soldiers backed their trucks up to it, and one of them opened up on the house with a   machine gun. Others peeked over the berm, taking the occasional potshot. One walked up to a gap in the dirt and, with neither cover nor helmet, a cigarette dangling from his lips, emptied a magazine. The   jammed. The fighting subsided again. The soldiers reclined at the base of the berm. Out came the phones. More selfies. Texting. A man called his mother. Another watched a video of a firefight taking place on some other front around Mosul. None of them seemed eager to storm the house. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m deaf from that cannon!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cDid you take any photos of it being shot?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another asked him. The gunner got into an argument with another soldier over whose responsibility it had been to make sure the   was working properly that morning. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cYou were supposed to fix it!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s not my job!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s not as if you had to build an airplane. It\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s simple. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cYou came all the way to the front in a taxi, and now all you do is talk. You just talk. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Another burst of gunfire from the house, and a soldier climbed behind the   gun. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cCome help me,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he instructed a colleague. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t know how. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIf you don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t get up here and help me, I\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m going to do everything that\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s bad to you. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The gun was loaded and fired. The backblast shattered a pickup\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s windshield. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cBazan, where are your cigarettes?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Bazan ran to a truck and returned with a pack of cigarettes. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWho wants a cigarette?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The group lit up. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cEveryone here talks like a man,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cbut no one fights like one. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d There was a note of false modesty in this quip. In fact, for centuries Kurds have fought famously, taking on all comers: Persians, Ottomans, Arabs, British and the various governments of Iraq. A diffuse institution  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cmore an attitude than an army,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d as one Kurd put it  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   the pesh merga today contain anywhere from several tens of thousands to about a hundred thousand fighters, depending on who\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s counting and how proud he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s feeling. Many are volunteers. Only some of them have training that would warrant the name in a major military. The one thing they all share is that they are willing to die for their land. If their tactics are negligible  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and sometimes as suicidal as those of the jihadists  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   their bravery is not. The pesh merga are commanded by Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government. When ISIS overran Mosul in June 2014, Barzani offered the help of his army to Prime Minister Nuri Kamal   who snubbed him. It was assumed Maliki worried that Barzani intended to annex whatever land his troops took. Maliki\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s successor, Haider   may have delayed the invasion of Mosul for the same reason. But earlier this year, Barzani, Abadi and the international coalition arrived at an agreement that called for the Kurdish forces to halt their advance at Bashiqa. About six miles from the eastern outskirts of Mosul, Bashiqa was inhabited largely by Christians, Kurds and members of the Yazidi minority, most of whom fled when ISIS arrived. The city presented an added political wrinkle in the war because it is in the \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cdisputed territories,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d land claimed by both Iraq and the Kurdish regional government. Certain Kurds, mainly older ones, consider Mosul theirs, too. Partly for this reason  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   but more because they\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re accustomed to fighting against the Iraqi military, not alongside it  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   some pesh merga worried they would be attacked, or at least mistreated, by Iraqi soldiers when the two forces met on the front lines. Speculation about a sequel war between Kurdistan and Iraq was (and still is) commonplace. But so far relations were cordial, and the Iraqi military, knowing it would have its hands full with the close combat in Mosul\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ancient streets, was content to leave the Bashiqa campaign to the Kurds. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis war is very different for us Kurds,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Barzani\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s brother, Sihad Barzani, explained several days after the campaign began. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis is the first time we\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ve seen airstrikes that we\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re not afraid of. This is the first time the Iraqi Army is not trying to kill us  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and we\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re not trying to kill them. We hope it stays this way. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He was in a large abandoned house that the pesh merga had commandeered and turned into a field headquarters on the periphery of Bashiqa. The march had brought them to the limits of the city. They had not yet entered, but they had it surrounded. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS has no escape. They will have to die now. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The Barzanis are de facto royalty in Kurdistan. Massoud and Sihad\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s father, Mustafa, the patriarch of the incipient Iraqi Kurdish republic, led its revolution against Iraq until his death in 1979. It\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s common to meet pesh merga with tattoos of Mustafa\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s portrait. As Sihad stepped from the house, a young soldier lifted up his shirt to reveal the face of Mustafa, with his thick black mustache and checkered red head scarf, sprawled across his back. Sihad looked on approvingly. Asked how many of his own family members were fighting ISIS, he gestured at the soldiers gathered in the courtyard and said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re all my family. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The Tigris River valley is dotted with villages and olive groves. The ISIS fighters inhabiting it were experienced and disciplined. What they lacked in munitions they made up for in patience, as the pesh merga had learned. Some Kurds had developed a reluctant respect for their adversary. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey fight as if they want to die,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d it was often said. The night before, the jihadists had told the residents of Buharbuq, an   village near Bashiqa, to be ready to leave at 6 a. m. for Mosul. The intent was obvious: They would be used as human shields. In the middle of the night, the village fled en masse. After leaving the headquarters, Barzani\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s convoy passed the refugee caravan, 80 or so cars and trucks stretched along a roadside. The residents of Buharbuq had taken everyone and everything they could: children, mattresses, blankets, grandmothers, pots, buckets, sheep, chickens. One truck contained a motorized wheelchair, another seven newborn lambs. The women were still dressed according to ISIS decree, fully covered in black hijabs and abayas. Officers with the Asayish, a Kurdish internal security agency, met the villagers on the road with a fleet of buses that would take them to a   camp. A soldier pulled up with a freight truck full of crackers and water. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAll of our life is wasted in this ISIS mess,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a woman waiting in line said to her husband. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI feel a hundred years old. I hope ISIS goes to hell, then rots in hell. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m so tired,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d her husband replied. There were heartsick roadside reunions. Two old classmates, one a pesh merga who had fled Buharbuq, the other a shop owner who had stayed, hugged for the first time in two years. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLife was very bitter,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the shop owner told his friend. He pulled from his pocket a   note, less than a dollar. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis is all my money. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d A young man found his mother. She clung to his neck and wept and kissed his face again and again. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThank God,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d she muttered. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThank God. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Perhaps the bravest pesh merga are the drivers of earthmovers, who toil mere yards from ISIS positions. They are bombed, mortared, rocketed and sniped, all the while doing astonishingly fast work. Within two days of setting off toward Bashiqa, they had turned the valley into a grid of berms and trenches that prevented an ISIS breakout and cut off the group\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s supply lines. About 4, 000 Kurdish soldiers now occupied 100 positions and small encampments. The main camp was presided over by Barham Arif, one of the youngest and most respected generals in the pesh merga. Tall and taciturn, he led his men into battle in a jaunty     MRAP with a GoPro camera   to the hood. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS is not smart and not brave, but they brainwash stupid people,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Arif said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey give drugs to their fighters. They fight for 20 minutes and then run away. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d For months, Arif had lived with his men on the pesh merga\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s stalemated front line, on the ridge of Bashiqa Mountain, overlooking the valley. A modest cult of personality had formed around the general, and his camp was home to foreign volunteers and soldiers of fortune. There were American medics, a Brazilian and Czech videographer couple and, constantly at Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s side, a   Scottish   sniper in spectacles. On Facebook, under employer, he listed \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cpesh merga. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Generations of Kurds also converged in the camp. A few soldiers were in their 20s. Most were in their 30s, 40s and 50s. One soldier who had come down from the mountain with Arif was Kaefe Ahmed. Ahmed\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s father, also a pesh merga fighter, was killed by Iraqi soldiers when Ahmed was 4. Ten other family members had died in war. Ahmed refused to wear a camouflage uniform because, he said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cfor decades the Iraqi Army destroyed our land with these uniforms. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He had fought for more than 20 of his 37 years: in the Kurdish civil war, against Saddam Hussein\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s forces and now against ISIS. He and his cousin Robar Ali were in a unit with a   group of men, some of them related. When ISIS entered Mosul, they fought on its outskirts, before the pesh merga were ordered to withdraw. Had ISIS stopped there, Ahmed and Ali, like most Iraqi Kurds, wouldn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t have worried much about the jihadists living nearby. This was a conflict among Arabs, they felt, and at first ISIS was better than Saddam\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s Baathists ever were. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIn the beginning, the ISIS fighters were generally good with people,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Ahmed said. But then ISIS pushed into Kurdistan. Ahmed and Ali fought them in Sinjar, and then in Bashiqa, before it was overrun. The fighting there was particularly bitter. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re suicidal,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. The oldest soldier in the camp, as far as anyone knew, was a man named Jamil Rashid. When asked about his age, he first said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cA lot. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Later offerings ranged from 61 to 78. Asked how many battles he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099d fought in over the years, he said, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThat notebook does not have enough paper to write them all down. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He ate what food local   brought to the camp and slept wrapped in a thin blanket in a ditch. Five of his sons were in the pesh merga. One had recently been killed by ISIS. He had more grandchildren than he cared to count. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS is nothing  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   they\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ve been around for two years,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d said Rashid, who was fond of listing, in the profanest terms possible, the Iraqi premiers whose regimes he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099d fought against. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAbd   Qasim\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   the Iraqi prime minister of the early 1960s. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI screwed his mother. Then there was Ahmed Hassan   and then Saddam, and then Nuri  . He was a bad guy. And now  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   what\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s his name again?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAbadi,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a young soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cRight, Abadi. I fought all of them on this holy ground  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   for this holy ground. Our mud is holy. Whoever doesn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t fight for his land takes it in the [expletive]. This land is so precious. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWhy are you talking about history, Jamil?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another young soldier asked him. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re supposed to be discussing now. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cSo what if I talk about history?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Rashid said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s all the same, history and now. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d On Tuesday morning, Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s men prepared to assault Omar Qapchi, a village barely a   from his camp that was still under ISIS control. A commander had got hold of some villagers on a cellphone and was telling them what to do when the fighting started. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cStay together, don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t separate,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIf you see any ISIS, call this number. Take care of yourselves. We\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099re coming. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The armored personnel carriers and tanks and trucks filled up in moments. Far more soldiers wanted to take part in the assault than there was space in vehicles. Omar Qapchi, spreading about a mile down a slope that ended in an arterial road at the foot of Bashiqa Mountain, was made up of tightly packed   and   homes. Near its western gate, the column split into three smaller convoys. Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s convoy cut across a field toward the road. Though the ground was known to be full of I. E. D. s, some pesh merga cut one another off as they careered over suspicious patches of dirt and objects, racing to get into the action. When the convoy reached the road, muzzle flashes appeared in windows, and bullets whizzed by. The pesh merga strafed the buildings with   fire and grenades. At the eastern gate, the convoy hooked into the village. The streets were empty. From the residents who had phoned, it was known that about a dozen ISIS fighters were somewhere in the village. The convoy raced into the village center and suddenly found itself in a firefight with a contingent of ISIS gunmen, who, surrounded, had taken a stand at one end of a short, wide alley. The soldiers, on the other end, jumped from their vehicles, piled into the alley  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   directly in the line of fire  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and began shooting back. There was little aiming but a lot of yelling. One man stepped into the alley with a grenade launcher. He pulled the trigger. Nothing happened. He held the rocket inches from his nose and looked at it quizzically. As bullets hit the dirt near his feet, he slowly peeled off a piece of plastic wrapping, then lifted the launcher back onto his shoulder and tried again. This time it fired. The ISIS fighters took to their heels, and the soldiers, among them Ahmed, gave chase, eventually cornering several jihadists in a mosque. One detonated a suicide vest another was sheared in half by a rocket. By the end of the day, eight of them had died, three had escaped and one was captured. Three pesh merga sustained minor wounds. Rather than going on foot from house to house to make sure the village was cleared, they gathered outside it and celebrated. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI think I killed someone,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Rashid said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt would be a shame if I shot my rifle and didn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t kill anyone. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Two days later, the wind at their backs, Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s men moved on Faziliya, a neighboring village. The road to the village was littered with I. E. D. s, which sent up showers of gravel and tarmac. On the wall of a kiosk at the entrance to the village was  : \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cEvery ISIS man who dies goes to paradise. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d An ISIS flag fluttered on a fence post, but the roofs of the houses, which ranged steeply up the foot of the mountain, bore newly hung white flags: The town\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s residents were eagerly awaiting the pesh merga\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s arrival. Then gun and rocket fire erupted from a small, windowed spire on a building near the road. A tank reduced the building to smoking rubble. The people of Faziliya streamed from their homes and into the streets. They patted their heads  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   a Kurdish gesture of welcome  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   and kissed the soldiers. Children chanted: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cLong live pesh merga! Long live pesh merga!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d In the village square, a group of boys tore down an ISIS billboard. Soldiers shot off celebratory rounds. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWho has cigarettes?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a man asked the soldiers. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe want to smoke!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d A soldier found his wife and children  \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0094   their first meeting in more than two years. His mother emerged. She took hold of her son. They sank to the ground in an embrace, their tears streaming together. Back at Omar Qapchi, the few residents who had remained for the battle were gathered outside the village next to a caged soccer pitch, where they awaited interrogation by the soldiers and Asayish officers. An elderly woman wanted to know where her brother was. A rocket had destroyed his house, and he was nowhere to be seen. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cHe\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s dead,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a neighbor of hers explained, out of earshot, \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cbut she hasn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t found out yet. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d An officer had already determined that one resident was allied with ISIS. The man was dragged from the group, his hands bound behind his back with a scarf. A green knit face mask was pulled down over his eyes, and he was forced to the ground. He pleaded his innocence. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cShut up, you imbecile!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier yelled at him. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s obvious he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ISIS,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cJust look at his color. He\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s taken on the jihadists\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 color. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m not with ISIS, I swear!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the prisoner said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m a Kurd!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cShut up or I\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ll stuff this down your throat!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the first soldier said, jabbing his rifle\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s stock in the man\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s face. The officer was from Omar Qapchi and had fled the village as ISIS approached it in 2014. From his friends who had stayed, he had heard that the prisoner had driven an ambulance for the jihadists. His son, they said, was with ISIS, too. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI haven\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t done anything!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the prisoner protested. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI was just told to drive somewhere. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cHit him already,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d another soldier said. The prisoner\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s son, his hands also bound and face covered, was pushed down beside his father. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMy son is a student in Bashiqa,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the father said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ll tell you anything about him. Please don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t put the gun to his head. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m just following orders,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cDon\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t worry,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d said an Asayish commander who had arrived on the scene. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t know if he\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ISIS. We have to investigate. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cYou\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099ve humiliated my son!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cSo are you saying your son is ISIS or not?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d the soldier asked. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cHe\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s a student! He\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s in ninth grade!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d They were bundled into the bed of a pickup and driven away. The Islamic State, the pesh merga knew, hadn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t conquered such large swaths of the country with weapons alone. It had won sympathy among many Sunni Muslims who felt neglected by Iraq\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s   national government and abused by security forces. ISIS promised them protection and pride. Many of them saw ISIS as a way out of an already miserable existence. In a   camp near Khazer, another   town, an elderly farmer who\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099d fled the village of Topzawa, not far from Bashiqa, which the Iraqi military had taken a few days before, talked about the jihadists fondly. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMost of the young men who joined ISIS were poor,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey needed the money. They had no other options. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d He confessed that he had come to know some of the ISIS men in Topzawa well. They weren\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t foreigners, but Iraqis, ordinary ones. They were kind. They allowed him to travel wherever he wanted to sell his produce. He didn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t mind that the women in his family had to put on more clothing, and he wore a beard anyway. They treated his wife and daughters with the respect that Islam required. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cAt the beginning of Islam, with Muhammad, there were good rules. But with democracy, there are no rules. I\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099m a fair person. I believe in justice. But there are rules in Islam. No one can change them. Not you, not me, not anyone. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cISIS treated us as though we were free,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he went on. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe felt secure under them. In the final battle, they conducted themselves honorably. They fought until they died. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The Iraqi Army, by contrast, relied on foreign airstrikes. The bombs had killed 20 of his sheep, 10 of his chickens and 10 dogs, and when the soldiers finally arrived, they were \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cvery, very bad. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d They forced him from his home and made him come to this camp, where he endured humiliations. His hands were bound. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThey attacked my honor. They told me my wife and daughters had been raped by ISIS. I was disgraced. I wanted to kill myself. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Two weeks after the Bashiqa campaign began, President Barzani still hadn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t given the order to attack the city itself. Rumors about what would be found in it expanded by the day. The number of ISIS fighters supposedly hiding out there crept upward. There would be no end of I. E. D. s, people said, of suicide   of snipers. There would be tunnels everywhere. At General Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s camp, the berms had grown taller and the foxholes deeper. ISIS fighters had attacked by night, and by day they lobbed in mortar rounds and handcrafted missiles. Jamil Rashid spoke with a group of younger soldiers as gunfire rang out. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cThis is nothing,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s air. I like the sound of it. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Finally, the order was given. The night before the assault, Arif\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s troops gathered on the mountain above Bashiqa, in their old position. Ahmed and his cousin Ali were part of group of about 30 men who would descend the slope and enter Bashiqa on foot. In the morning, an armored column collected on a road outside the city. Sihad Barzani arrived to wish them luck. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe must move, but slowly,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. For six hours, the column crept toward the city, while airstrikes and artillery pummeled it. As they waited, soldiers checked for news of the American election, the next day, on their phones. Word came down that a sniper was holed up somewhere inside. He had already killed one soldier and wounded four. On the access road into the city\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s east end, which climbed up the mountainside, the column drove by a pesh merga bulldozer in flames, the driver incinerated in the cab. As in Omar Qapchi, the streets were quiet. But as the vehicles turned by a small park, a   grenade flew at it. Its orange fireball and white smoke trail, visible for less than a second, were terribly beautiful. The rocket exploded against the low concrete wall of the park. Another quickly followed behind it. The column made it to a central plaza. A handsome old church with a suspicious tower was peppered with   fire and artillery. Jamil Rashid hopped from the front seat of a truck and took up a position outside the church. Standing in the open, his rifle dangling by his leg, he looked around and breathed in the scent of gun smoke, beaming. The column turned back along the same road it had entered. But now there was an empty white sedan in the middle of an intersection. Was this a car bomb? A roadblock? Had some innocent tried to flee and suffered a breakdown? The driver of the lead tank stuck his head from the turret hatch. A shot cracked the air, its tone higher and sharper than that of a Kalashnikov. Blood sprayed from the driver\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s head. He slumped over the turret. His crew mates began screaming and crying. Panic passed down the line. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cSniper! Sniper!\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d The column reversed course, honking and   and labored back to the plaza. The tank sped from the city by a different route. At the staging point, the driver\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s body was lifted out and put in an ambulance. His friends bent over the tank\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s side skirt and knelt in the dirt, weeping. Before the driver was shot, Ahmed, Ali and their detachment had descended into the same side of the city on foot. They came under fire, retreated back uphill and took up a position. A   crack. Ali lurched forward, falling over Ahmed\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s leg. Ahmed thought his cousin had tripped. Then he saw the blood. Three days later, Ahmed was worrying a string of wooden prayer beads in a mosque in his and Ali\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s hometown, Rawanduz, in Kurdistan\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s eastern mountains. He sat by the muezzin, who sang a death prayer for Ali, a Quran open before him on a desk stand. Old pesh merga in traditional dress and younger ones in suits and jeans filed in. They greeted Ali\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s father and Ahmed, their hands to their chests, saying: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMay he rest in peace\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d and \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cMay God forgive him his sins. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d After the service, long rugs were spread on the floor, and Ahmed and the men from his unit sat down to lunch. Their part in the fight against ISIS was over, for now. Bashiqa was liberated, and the Kurdish line stopped there. But the war against ISIS was not going well for the Iraqi Army, which was still stuck on Mosul\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s outskirts, taking a lot of casualties. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt will be a heavy fight,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d one man said. Ahmed and his friends would fight in Mosul if they were ordered to, they agreed, but they wouldn\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t like it. They were not among the Kurds who considered the city part of the homeland. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIs it fair that a Kurd should die for an Arab?\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Ahmed said. Anyway, history had taught them that another war would come soon enough. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cOnce you finish one fight, they prepare another one for you,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d a soldier said. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt makes you tired. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d\",\n          \"Share on Twitter \\nThe battle of campaign rallies has been going strong throughout the 2016 presidential election, with both candidates amassing pretty large crowds. \\nJust last month, the Washington Post compared two separate September rallies for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. \\nTrump's had a crowd of 15,000, at his Sept. 27th rally in Melbourne, Florida: Unbelievable evening in Melbourne, Florida w/ 15,000 supporters- and an additional 12,000 who could not get in.

They raised the 2016 American League pennant and handed out rings before the focus turned back to the current season. It is a season in which the Indians may again be one of the top teams in baseball, but it is also one in which they may have to wrestle increasingly with the issue of Chief Wahoo, the smiling caricature that has long been an Indians logo but has come to be seen as offensive and wildly outdated. Among those who think it is time for the club to decisively move away from the logo is the Major League Baseball commissioner, Rob Manfred, who in continuing discussions with the team\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s ownership is beginning to apply a little bit of pressure on the club to come up with a plan of action. In a statement to The New York Times, Pat Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said Manfred, in his talks with the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 owners, had made clear his \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cdesire to transition away from the Chief Wahoo logo. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe have specific steps in an identified process and are making progress,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 Courtney added. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe are confident that a positive resolution will be reached that will be good for the game and the club. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 Although Manfred had previously acknowledged a willingness to engage in talks with the Indians about the logo, Courtney\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s statement appears to be the first time that Manfred is identified as having staked out a clear position on the issue. It is an issue, however, that may not be that easy to resolve. Although many people, including baseball fans around the country, would welcome the removal of Chief Wahoo, there is a significant segment of the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 fan base that still cherishes the logo, which has existed in various forms since 1947. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cChief Wahoo is the Cleveland Indians,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d said Karen Hale, a local Indians fan who was outside the stadium before Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s game. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI think there comes a time when you have to take a stand for what you believe in. I don\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099t think it\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s hurting anybody. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Philip Yenyo, the executive director of the American Indian Movement of Ohio, has been protesting at the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 opening day games for years and vehemently disagrees with Hale and others with similar views. He would prefer the team eliminate the logo, and the Indians name as well, but he would be happy for the club to start with the logo. During this year\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s protest, Yenyo engaged in a cordial conversation with a team employee. And Yenyo said that over the years the Indians had been very cooperative in arranging for security to protect the two dozen or so protesters who do show up outside the stadium. Still, as Yenyo spoke through a megaphone at Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s demonstration, a man barreled through the protesters and yelled at him: \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cIt\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s a caricature. Get over it. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d Bob DiBiasio, the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 senior vice president for public affairs, said during Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s home opener that the club understood the passion on both sides of the issue and that in some ways the team was caught in the middle, trying to find an amicable solution. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cWe certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo, those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a longstanding attachment to its place in the history of the team,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said. DiBiasio called the continuing talks productive between Manfred and Paul Dolan, the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 chairman and chief executive. With their sights set on a return to the World Series, the Indians would prefer to address Chief Wahoo after the season to avoid any distractions that could alienate a large swath of fans while games are being played. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cOur primary focus right now is on the team,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 he said. And it may be a really good team, especially with the addition of Edwin Encarnacion, the   slugger who left Toronto to sign a   $60 million contract with the Indians. The club has already sold 1. 3 million tickets for the 2017 season, DiBiasio said, noting that it did not reach that mark until the end of July last year. In 2016, Cleveland\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s attendance was 28th out of 30 teams with 1. 59 million tickets sold, but in the wake of the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 2016 postseason run, that number is now likely to soar. Manager Terry Francona noted Tuesday that his team seemed to thrive when the stadium was full, as it was Tuesday, when the Indians prevailed in extra innings against the Chicago White Sox. And sure enough, many of the fans in attendance wore the Chief Wahoo logo on their hats and shirts. The move to do away with the logo appeared to begin when Mark Shapiro, who is now running the Blue Jays, was the Indians\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099 team president for baseball operations. Shapiro was the driving force behind   the block C logo, which has been seen on Cleveland caps since 1902 and has recently become more prominent on various uniform and cap combinations the Indians use, as well as around the stadium. During last year\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s American League Championship Series between the Blue Jays and Indians, Shapiro said that he was personally troubled by the Wahoo logo and suggested that its days were numbered. \\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009cI think there will be a day, whenever that is, that the people that are making decisions here decide that Chief Wahoo is no longer fitting,\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u009d he said then. When the   Jays playoff series moved to Toronto last October, an indigenous Canadian citizen filed for an injunction to prevent Cleveland from using the Wahoo logo while in Canada. Major League Baseball joined the Indians in opposing the injunction, which was not granted. But in its statement at the time baseball said it also welcomed dialogue about the logo. That dialogue began in the weeks after the World Series and will most likely continue until a resolution is reached. At Tuesday\\u00c3\\u00a2\\u00c2\\u0080\\u00c2\\u0099s game, the Chief Wahoo logo could not be seen anywhere on the stadium building or on the field, but it was on the left sleeves of the blue jerseys worn by the Indians players and on their caps. And it was on the white uniform shirts worn by the Cleveland sports legends Jim Brown, Austin Carr and Jim Thome when they went to the mound to throw out the celebratory first pitches before the game. The logo could also be found on many items in the team souvenir shop, along with stickers depicting an even harsher representation of Chief Wahoo from an earlier period. For now, at least, the logo still survives and even thrives.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"
